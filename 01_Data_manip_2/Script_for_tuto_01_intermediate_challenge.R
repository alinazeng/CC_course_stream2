(1)
# The Craigmillar Castle team would like a summary of the different species 
# found within its grounds, but broken down in four quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW). 
      # You can start from the trees.genus object created earlier.

# Can you calculate the species richness (e.g. the number of different species) 
# in each quadrant?

(2)
# They would also like to know how abundant the genus Acer is (as a % of the 
# total number of trees) in each quadrant.

(3)
# Finally, they would like, for each quadrant separately, a bar plot showing 
# counts of Acer trees in the different age classes, ordered so they read from 
# Young (lumping together juvenile and semi-mature trees), Middle Aged, and 
# Mature.
